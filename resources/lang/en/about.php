        'introduction-p2'  =>  'The Reserve is mainly recognized for the presence of majestic Royal Bengal Tiger,which is the National Animal of India and practically one of the most fascinating animal in the world. BTR with some of its dense forests, bamboo vegetations and vast grasslands along with some perennial streams, offers an excellent habitat for the solitary predator. Over the years, under the expert management practices of administrative body the reserve has witnessed a significant rise in number of the Tigersand is among the top reserves with high density of Tigers. Together with abundanceof prey species in tourism areas its one the best parks to sight the Big Cat in its full grandeur.',
        'introduction-p3'  =>  'Bandhavgarh Tiger reserve has great historical significance also which is evidenced by the presence of the Famous Bandhavgarh fort, various Caves, Rock paintings and carvings inside the Protected Area.Thus, Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve has its uniqueness where nature and history are inseparable.',
        'introduction-p4'  =>  'The park consists of three distinct areas i.e. ‘Bandhavgarh National Park’, ‘Panpatha Wildlife Sanctuary’ which make up the “Core Area” and the adjoining notified “Buffer Area” spread across the districts of Umaria, Shahdol and Katni.',
        'history-p1'    =>  'India is famously a land of mythology, folklore and legends and same is true for Bandhavgarh too. Legend has it that the Bandhavgarh Fort was given to brother Lakshman by Lord Ram, one of the most revered Hindu God-incarnates; to keep watch on Lanka and hence the fort acquired the name “Bandhavgarh” (Bandhav – brother, Garh – fort). Elaborations tell that the Monkey-god Hanuman and his followers raised the high cliff-walls of the Fort to make it almost impenetrable.',
        'history-p2'    =>  'References to this fort are also found in the Narad Panch Ratna and Shiva Sanhita Puran.(Purans are ancient Hindu texts eulogizing various deities in Hindu religion). The man-made caves with their inscriptions and rock-paintings have made archaeologists to date Bandhavgarh settlements back to Pre-Christ times if not pre-historic.',
        'history-p3'    =>  'The earliest available historical data is from “Bhimseni Sanwat” which dates back to 300 A.D., during which the fort was under the BharhivasVakatak Dynasty. Inscription of king Bhimsen are still found in one of the caves. Subsequently the fort came under the possession of Sengars, Kalachuris Rajputs and Baghels which were ruling the area till 1494 A.D. From 1495-1535 A.D. the Kuruvanshees took over the custody of the fort, however it came under the rule of Baghels again in 1535 A.D.',
        'history-p4'    =>  'Once the fort changes hands, it remained with the Baghels till the time of Independence of India. In the year 1617 A.D. the Baghels decided to shift their capital to Rewa, a move which not only made Baghels to be famously known as Maharajas of Rewa but also became a boon for the area now under the reserve. Once the royal family moved to Rewa the fort gradually became less and less inhabited and the villages around the fort also started moving to other areas.',
        'history-p5'    =>  'With the constantly reducing human pressure, the habitat around the fort responded and a dense, diverse jungle started flourishing which helped the Tiger and other wildlife establish itself firmly in the area. The fort and adjoining habitat were gradually deserted completely and the last few inhabitants left the fort in 1935 A.D. though the ownership to the fort remained with the Maharajas of Rewa, who after moving to Rewa had declared the area as their private hunting game reserve with only the Royal family having the rights to hunt the Tiger. Thus before coming under the control of Government of India post-independence, Bandhavgarh was the “Game Reserve” of the Maharajas of Rewa.',
        'conservation-p1'    =>  'Bandhavgarh has been an excellent habitat for Tigers which was under the control of Baghels, rules of Rewa state; who had declared it as their private Game Reserve, known as their “Shikargaah”. Consequently, the fort, the area of reserve and the surrounding forests were passionately protected by the Royal Family who had the exclusive hunting rights in the area. After independence of India and abolition of princely states, the forest in the area started degrading due to lack of proper control.',
        'conservation-p2'    =>  'The state of Madhya Pradesh was formed in 1956 and the state also realized the ecological importance of Bandhavgarh. Maharaja Martand Singh of Rewa, who was already deeply moved by the degradation of Forests took initiative to protect the area and its rich Bio-diversity and on his proposal an area of 105 sq. km was notified as National Park in 1968.',
        'conservation-p3'    =>  'The original national park area is mostly under the current Tala Range of the Park. In 1982 the area of the park was extended to 448.842 sq. km. and three more ranges namely, Khitauli, Magdhi and Kallawah were added to Tala Range.',
        'conservation-p4'    =>  'One of the most intensive conservation efforts in India and perhaps the world, Project Tiger was officially launched in the year 1973 with the objective of improving the population of Tigers in India which had been dwindling considerably over the years. Considering the importance and potentiality of the Bandhavgarh National Park, it was included in the Project Tiger network in 1993. Panpatha Sanctuary (which was created in 1983 with an area of 245.847 sq. km) was merged into the core area of Tiger Reserve, there-by increasing the core area to 694.689 sq. km along with the buffer area of 437 sq kms. Thus Bandhavgarh National Park which came into existence in 1968 was officially entitled as Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve under Project Tiger.',
